# Virtual-Hand-Detector
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a lightweight, real-time computer vision system designed to detect when a user's hand enters a hazardous area. By creating a virtual boundary on the live camera feed, the system tracks the hand's distance and triggers visual alerts ("DANGER DANGER") upon contact.
